Audios taken from youtube are used to get material to learn. From those audios this webapp will present a way to practise both hearing natural speakers and reading characters.

# 1. Listening mode | 听到
In this mode you'll hear a sound, and the goal is to repeat it in your head and try to guess the meaning. Then you hit the right arrow and see the meaning of the audio line and the characters used. 

# 2. Type the pinzi mode | 字符
You will see a character and you will have to type the corresponding pinzi.
